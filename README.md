# mars-news-challenge

In this challenge we take on a full web-scraping and data analysis project. By identifying HTML elements on a page, their id and class attributes, we extract information via both automated browsing with Splinter and HTML parsing with Beautiful Soup. Through the use of web scraping, we scrape titles and preview text from Mars news articles (1st notebook) as well as scrape and analyze Mars weather data (2nd notebook), which exists in a table.
